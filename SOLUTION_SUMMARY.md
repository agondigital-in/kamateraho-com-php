# Solution Summary: Apply Now Button Issue

## Problem Description
When users click the "Apply Now" button on product or credit card pages:
1. The page URL opens correctly
2. However, the amount request is not being sent to the admin panel
3. Admins cannot see or process these requests

## Root Cause
The original implementation only redirected users to external URLs without creating any record in the admin panel for processing.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified product_details.php
- Added functionality to create a withdraw request when "Apply Now" is clicked
- Requests are stored in the `withdraw_requests` table with a special UPI ID format (`purchase@timestamp`) to identify them as purchase/application requests
- Added success/error messaging for users
- Maintained the original redirect behavior to external URLs

### 2. Enhanced Admin Panel (admin/index.php)
- Updated the pending requests display to clearly distinguish between:
  - Regular withdrawal requests (badge: blue "Withdrawal")
  - Purchase/application requests (badge: green "Purchase Request")
- Shows offer title and description for purchase requests

### 3. Updated Approval Process (admin/approve_withdraw.php)
- Modified to handle purchase requests differently from regular withdrawals:
  - Regular withdrawals: Deduct amount from user's wallet
  - Purchase requests: Add amount to user's wallet (when approved)
- Added clearer messaging for both types of requests

### 4. Database Schema Update
- Ensured `withdraw_requests` table has the necessary columns:
  - `offer_title` - to store the offer/card title
  - `offer_description` - to store the offer/card description

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks "Apply Now"**:
   - A purchase request is created in the database
   - User is redirected to the external URL as before

2. **Admin sees the request**:
   - Purchase requests appear in the admin dashboard with a green "Purchase Request" badge
   - Request details include offer title and description

3. **Admin approves the request**:
   - When approved, the specified amount is added to the user's wallet
   - A record is added to the wallet history
   - User receives a notification (if implemented)

## Testing
A test script (`test_purchase_request.php`) was created to verify the functionality.

## Files Modified
- `product_details.php` - Main user interface
- `admin/index.php` - Admin dashboard display
- `admin/approve_withdraw.php` - Approval logic
- `update_database.php` - Schema update script
- `test_purchase_request.php` - Test script

## Next Steps
1. Access `update_database.php` through your web browser to ensure the database schema is updated
2. Test the functionality by clicking "Apply Now" on any product or credit card
3. Check the admin panel to see the request appear
4. Approve the request to see the amount added to the user's wallet
