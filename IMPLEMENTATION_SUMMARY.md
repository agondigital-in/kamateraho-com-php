# Category Management with Logo and Price Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds functionality to the admin panel to allow adding categories with price and logo/photo upload capabilities, and displays these categories on the frontend with the requested layout.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Updates
- Added `price` column (DECIMAL(10,2)) to the `categories` table
- Utilized existing `photo` column for storing category images (instead of creating a new `logo` column)

### 2. Admin Panel Files Modified

#### admin/add_category.php
- Added form fields for price input (number field)
- Added file upload for category photo
- Updated database insertion to include price and photo fields
- Added file validation for image uploads
- Created upload directory if it doesn't exist

#### admin/edit_category.php (New File)
- Created new file for editing existing categories
- Added form fields for price and photo upload
- Implemented photo replacement functionality with old photo deletion
- Updated database records with new values

#### admin/manage_categories.php
- Added columns to display price and photo in the categories table
- Added "Edit" button for each category
- Updated table structure to show all relevant information

### 3. Frontend Display (index.php)
- Modified the "Best Promotion Tasks For You To Start" section to display:
  - Category photo/logo (circular display)
  - Price below the photo (in ₹ format)
  - Category name below the price
- Implemented fallback to default images when no photo is available
- Maintained existing scrolling behavior

### 4. Backend Scripts
- Created database update script to add required columns
- Created test scripts to verify functionality
