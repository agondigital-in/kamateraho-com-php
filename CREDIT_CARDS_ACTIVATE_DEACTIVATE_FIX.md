# Credit Cards Activate/Deactivate Fix

## Issue
The activate/deactivate functionality for credit cards in the admin panel was not working properly.

## Root Cause Analysis
After reviewing the code, I identified that the issue was with the redirect method being used after updating the credit card status. The code was using JavaScript redirects which can be unreliable in some cases.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Changed Redirect Method
Updated the redirect method in [admin/manage_credit_cards.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/admin/manage_credit_cards.php) from JavaScript redirect to PHP header redirect for better reliability.

#### Before:
```php
// Use JavaScript redirect to avoid headers already sent error
echo "<script>window.location.href = 'manage_credit_cards.php?success=" . urlencode("Credit card status updated successfully!") . "';</script>";
exit;
```

#### After:
```php
// Use PHP header redirect for better reliability
header("Location: manage_credit_cards.php?success=" . urlencode("Credit card status updated successfully!"));
exit;
```

This change was applied to both the toggle active functionality and the delete functionality.

### 2. Created Debugging Scripts
Created two debugging scripts to help verify the functionality:

1. [check_credit_cards_table.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/check_credit_cards_table.php) - Checks the credit_cards table structure and sample records
2. [test_toggle_credit_card.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/test_toggle_credit_card.php) - Tests the toggle functionality directly

## How to Test the Fix

1. Visit the admin panel and go to "Manage Credit Cards"
2. Try activating/deactivating credit cards using the buttons
3. Verify that the status changes are reflected immediately after the page reloads
4. You can also run the debugging scripts to verify database functionality:
   - `http://your-domain/check_credit_cards_table.php`
   - `http://your-domain/test_toggle_credit_card.php`

## Additional Notes

- The form implementation for toggling active status was already correct
- The database structure for the [is_active](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/admin/manage_credit_cards.php#L168-L168) field was properly defined
- The issue was primarily with the redirect method after updating the status

## Expected Result
After applying these fixes, the activate/deactivate buttons should work properly, and the status changes should be immediately visible in the admin panel.
