# Admin Referral Stats Header Error Fix

## Issue
The admin panel was showing a "Cannot modify header information - headers already sent" warning in referral_stats.php. This occurred because the file was including database.php, which outputs HTML content, before trying to redirect with `header()`.

## Root Cause
In PHP, HTTP headers must be sent before any output is sent to the browser. When database.php was included in referral_stats.php, it immediately started outputting HTML content. Later in referral_stats.php, when trying to redirect non-admin users with `header('Location: login.php')`, PHP threw an error because headers had already been sent.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated referral_stats.php
Modified `admin/referral_stats.php` to use the new `db_connect.php` instead of `database.php`:
- Replaced `include 'auth.php'` and `include 'database.php'` with `include 'db_connect.php'`
- Maintained all functionality while fixing the header issue

### 2. Preserved database.php Functionality
The existing `admin/database.php` file remains unchanged for its intended purpose as a standalone database management page.

## Files Modified

1. **Updated file**: `admin/referral_stats.php` - Now uses db_connect.php instead of database.php

## Testing
The file has been verified with PHP linting and shows no syntax errors.

## Best Practices Applied
1. Separated concerns - database connection logic is separate from HTML output
2. Maintained backward compatibility - existing database.php functionality unchanged
3. Followed PHP header best practices - all redirects happen before output
4. Applied proper session management - checking if session is already active
