# Authentication Flow Summary

## Project Structure
The project now has two distinct entry points:
1. `kmt/kamateraho/index.php` - Public landing page (no authentication required)
2. `kmt/index.php` - Main application page (requires authentication)

## User Flow

### 1. Public Access
- Users can access `https://kamateraho1.agondev.space/kamate%20raho/index.php` without logging in
- This page provides information about the service and links to authentication

### 2. Authentication Process
- From the public landing page, users can click "Login" or "Register"
- After successful registration, users are redirected to the login page
- After successful login, users are redirected to the main application page

### 3. Main Application Access
- `https://kamateraho1.agondev.space/index.php` requires authentication
- Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to the login page
- Authenticated users can access all application features

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files:

1. **`kmt/index.php`**
   - Added session management at the beginning of the file
   - Users who are not logged in are redirected to `login.php`
   - Preserves all existing functionality for authenticated users

2. **`kmt/login.php`**
   - After successful authentication, redirects to `index.php` (the main application)
   - All other functionality remains unchanged

3. **`kmt/register.php`**
   - After successful registration, redirects to `login.php` after 3 seconds
   - All other functionality remains unchanged

4. **`kmt/kamateraho/index.php`**

   - `kmt/profile.php` - Redirects unauthenticated users to `index.php`
   - `kmt/withdraw.php` - Redirects unauthenticated users to `index.php`

4. **Access Main Application**

   - If not logged in, should be redirected to login page
   - If logged in, should see the main application page

5. **Access Protected Pages**

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Clear Separation**: Public information is separate from private application
2. **User Experience**: Visitors can learn about the service before committing to login
3. **Security**: All protected pages require authentication
4. **Consistency**: All redirects work correctly within the new structure
5. **Maintainability**: Clear flow makes it easy to understand and modify
