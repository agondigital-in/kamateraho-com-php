# Credit Cards Duplication Fix

## Issue
Credit cards were appearing multiple times on the index page, which was not desired.

## Root Cause Analysis
After reviewing the code, I identified that the issue was caused by:
1. No deduplication mechanism in place to prevent credit cards with the same title from appearing multiple times
2. No limit on the number of credit cards displayed

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Deduplication Logic
Modified the credit cards fetching logic in [index.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/index.php) to remove duplicate credit cards based on their title:

```php
// Remove duplicate credit cards based on title
$seen_titles = [];
$unique_credit_cards = [];
foreach ($credit_cards as $card) {
    if (!in_array($card['title'], $seen_titles)) {
        $seen_titles[] = $card['title'];
        $unique_credit_cards[] = $card;
    }
}
$credit_cards = $unique_credit_cards;
```

### 2. Added Limit on Number of Credit Cards
Added a limit to display a maximum of 8 credit cards:

```php
// Limit to 8 credit cards maximum
$credit_cards = array_slice($credit_cards, 0, 8);
```

### 3. Created Debugging Script
Created a debugging script to check for duplicate credit cards in the database:
- [check_duplicate_credit_cards.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/check_duplicate_credit_cards.php) - Checks for duplicate credit cards

## How the Fix Works

1. When fetching credit cards from the database, the system now:
   - Normalizes image paths as before
   - Removes duplicate credit cards that have the same title
   - Limits the display to a maximum of 8 credit cards

2. The deduplication works by:
   - Creating an array to track seen titles
   - Iterating through all credit cards
   - Only adding cards to the final list if their title hasn't been seen before

## Testing the Fix

1. Visit the main page of your website
2. Verify that credit cards with the same title don't appear multiple times
3. Check that no more than 8 credit cards are displayed
4. Run the debugging script to check for duplicates in the database:
   - `http://your-domain/check_duplicate_credit_cards.php`

## Additional Notes

- The fix preserves the most recently added credit card when duplicates are found (due to the `ORDER BY created_at DESC` clause)
- The limit of 8 cards can be adjusted by changing the number in `array_slice($credit_cards, 0, 8)`
- The fix only affects the display on the index page and doesn't modify the database

## Expected Result
After applying these fixes, duplicate credit cards should no longer appear on the index page, and the display will be limited to 8 unique credit cards.
