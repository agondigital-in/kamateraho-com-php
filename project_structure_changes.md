# Project Structure Changes Summary

## Overview
The project structure has been modified to create two distinct entry points:
1. `kmt/index.php` - Main application page (requires authentication)
2. `kamate raho/index.php` - Public landing page (no authentication required)

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `kmt/index.php`
- Added session management to require user authentication
- Users not logged in are redirected to the login page
- Preserved all existing functionality for authenticated users

### 2. Updated `kamate raho/index.php`
- Updated navigation links to point to the correct login/register pages
- Updated hero section buttons to link to the main registration page
- Updated withdrawal section button to link to registration

### 3. Updated Authentication Flow
- Modified `login.php` to redirect to `index.php` after successful login
- Confirmed `register.php` redirects to `login.php` after registration
- Updated `dashboard.php`, `profile.php`, and `withdraw.php` to redirect to `index.php` when not authenticated

### 4. Navigation Consistency
- All protected pages now redirect to `index.php` when user is not authenticated
- Public landing page (`kamate raho/index.php`) provides clear paths to login/registration

## File Structure
```
kmt/
├── index.php                 # Main application (requires login)
├── login.php                 # Login page
├── register.php              # Registration page
├── dashboard.php             # User dashboard
├── profile.php               # User profile
├── withdraw.php              # Withdrawal system
├── logout.php                # Logout functionality
└── kamate raho/
    └── index.php             # Public landing page (no login required)
```

## User Flow
1. Visitors access `kamate raho/index.php` as the public landing page
2. They can navigate to login or register through the navigation or buttons
3. After authentication, they are directed to `kmt/index.php`
4. All protected pages check for authentication and redirect to `index.php` if not logged in
5. Logout redirects users back to the main index page

## Benefits
- Clear separation between public and private areas
- Improved user experience with proper authentication flow
- Maintained all existing functionality
- Enhanced security by ensuring protected pages require authentication
