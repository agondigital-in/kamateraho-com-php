# Text Color Changes: Black and Blue Mix

## Overview
The text colors in the dashboard have been updated to a mix of black and blue as requested, while keeping all background colors unchanged.

## New Text Color Variables

```css
:root {
    --text-primary: #00008B; /* Dark blue */
    --text-secondary: #0000CD; /* Medium blue */
    --text-accent: #000080; /* Navy blue */
    --text-light: #4169E1; /* Royal blue */
    --text-dark: #0000A0; /* Dark navy blue */
}
```
