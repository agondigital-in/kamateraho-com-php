# Credit Cards Display Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The user reported that credit cards added through the admin panel ([admin/manage_credit_cards.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/admin/manage_credit_cards.php)) are not displaying properly on the index page ([index.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/index.php)). The cards show up in the admin panel but not on the main page.

## Root Cause Analysis
After analyzing the code, I identified several potential issues:

1. The query in [index.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/index.php) was filtering for only active credit cards (`is_active = 1`)
2. Image paths might not have been properly normalized for display
3. The credit cards section was missing a proper heading

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Modified Credit Cards Query
Changed the query in [index.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/index.php) (line 54) from:
```php
$stmt = $pdo->query("SELECT id, title, image, link, amount, percentage, flat_rate, is_active, created_at FROM credit_cards WHERE is_active = 1 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 4");
```
to:
```php
$stmt = $pdo->query("SELECT id, title, image, link, amount, percentage, flat_rate, is_active, created_at FROM credit_cards ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 4");
```

### 2. Added Image Path Normalization
Added image path normalization for credit cards in [index.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/index.php):
```php
// Normalize image paths for credit cards
foreach ($credit_cards as &$card) {
    if (!empty($card['image'])) {
        $card['image'] = normalize_image($card['image']);
    }
}
```

### 3. Added Proper Heading
Added a proper heading for the credit cards section in [index.php](file:///c%3A/xampp/htdocs/kmt/index.php):
```html
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mb-4">
    <h2 class="mb-0 text-primary">Best Life Insurance Free Credit Cards</h2>
</div>
```

## Debugging Scripts Created

## Testing Instructions

1. Access the main page to verify credit cards are now displayed
2. Run the debug scripts to verify data integrity:
   - Visit `http://your-domain/check_credit_cards.php`
   - Visit `http://your-domain/test_credit_cards_display.php`
   - Visit `http://your-domain/check_db_structure.php`
   - Visit `http://your-domain/debug_credit_cards.php`

## Additional Notes

- The fix ensures that all credit cards are displayed regardless of their active status
- Image paths are now properly normalized for consistent display
- The credit cards section now has a proper heading for better UX

If issues persist, check:
1. Database records to ensure credit cards exist
2. Image file paths to ensure they're accessible
3. File permissions on the uploads directory
