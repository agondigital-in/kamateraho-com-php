# Dashboard Changes Summary

## Overview
The dashboard has been updated to change all text colors to black and add a Revenue Overview section as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Text Color Changes
- All text colors have been changed to black (#000000) as requested
- Updated CSS variables in the `:root` selector:

  - `--text-secondary: #000000`
  - `--text-accent: #000000`
  - `--text-light: #000000`
  - `--text-dark: #000000`
- Applied these variables throughout the stylesheet to ensure all text elements use black color

### 2. Revenue Overview Section
- Added a new "Revenue Overview" section with four revenue cards:
  - Today's Revenue
  - This Week
  - This Month
  - Total Revenue
- Added PHP code to fetch and display revenue data
- Created new CSS styles for the revenue section:
  - `.revenue-card` - Card styling
  - `.revenue-title` - Section title styling
  - `.revenue-stat` - Statistics container
  - `.revenue-amount` - Revenue amount styling
  - `.revenue-label` - Label styling

### 3. PHP Backend Updates
- Added revenue data variables:
  - `$today_revenue`
  - `$week_revenue`
  - `$month_revenue`
  - `$total_revenue`
